"""
Walk-Forward Statistics — reusable overfitting diagnostics.

All functions work on arrays/Series of Sharpe ratios or returns,
and can be used independently of the walk-forward engine.

Usage::

    from backtester.walkforward.statistics import (
        overfit_ratio,
        efficiency,
        sharpe_decay,
        deflated_sharpe,
        probability_of_backtest_overfitting,
        aggregate_oos_returns,
        compute_composite_metrics,
        interpret_metrics,
    )
