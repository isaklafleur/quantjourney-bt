# QuantJourney Backtester Changelog

## 0.8.9 - 2026-07-08

### Changed
- Weight-mode accounting now books the full price move across missing-data gaps on the resume bar (matching order-mode economics), and gapped positions are reported at their carried value.
- Honest walk-forward reporting: slice-diagnostics output is labeled in-sample end-to-end, failed folds are reported as failed (not zero Sharpe), verdicts are gated so losing strategies never render green, and the composite Sharpe carries a bootstrap confidence interval.
- Stricter, louder input handling: unknown constructor kwargs raise, execution mode and fill timing are validated, missing OHLC data degrades with a clear warning, inactive configuration knobs warn once per mode, and the tracking-error trigger activates when `benchmark_returns` is provided.
- Re-running a backtest on the same instance is idempotent (execution state resets per run); weekly calendar rebalances snap to the prior trading day on holidays; documentation now spells out the execution-timing contract and calendar-convention sensitivity.

## 0.8.8 - 2026-07-08

### Changed
- Refined same-bar fill priority for OCO orders and aligned the tracking-error trigger with the NAV accounting basis.
- Cleaner walk-forward metadata and configuration errors (empty purge windows, overlapping-OOS warning, early CPCV validation).

## 0.8.7 - 2026-07-07

### Changed
- Tightened rebalance and risk-event accounting so daily returns are always booked on the weights actually held, with improved circuit-breaker recovery behavior.
- Hardened order execution around partial fills and edge conditions: trailing-stop activation, OCO and bracket lifecycle, bar-expiry counting, stop-limit trigger bounds, and volume-cap handling with incomplete data.
- More robust input validation across sizing, weights and configuration (non-finite prices and volumes, cash-buffer types, rebalance frequency and holiday scheduling).
- Protective `stop_loss()`/`take_profit()` exits now link as an OCO pair automatically.
- Walk-forward upgrades: more reliable optimizer execution with loud failure reporting, `direction="minimize"` support, deflated Sharpe aligned with Bailey & López de Prado (2014), and honest availability reporting for overfitting statistics (`pbo_trials` opt-in).

## 0.8.6 - 2026-07-06

### Added
- Added explicit walk-forward mode reporting in logs, summaries and archived metadata: `slice_diagnostics` for fast NAV-slice diagnostics and `per_fold_refit` when a fold-local `backtester_factory` reruns the strategy.
- Added `QJ_WF_MODE=per_fold_refit` support to WF01-WF03 examples, with optional `QJ_WF_REPORT_PACKET=1` report/plot packet generation.

### Changed
- Deduplicated the walk-forward slice-diagnostics warning so it appears once per result instead of once per fold.
- Clarified README and strategy-catalog language around walk-forward diagnostics, per-fold refit cost, and optimization workflow interpretation.

## 0.8.5 - 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- Fixed order-mode trade recording so fill metadata from the execution engine (`slippage`, theoretical price and fill status) is accepted by the blotter and preserved in trade artifacts.
- Hardened the 30-minute intraday stop-breakout example against sparse provider bars by skipping invalid NAV, price and breakout-reference observations before sizing orders.

## 0.8.4 - 2026-07-04

### Added
- Added a deterministic bundled sample-data path for `example_weights_01_sma_daily` via `./strategy.sh example_weights_01_sma_daily --sample-data`, allowing a reproducible demo without API credentials.

## 0.8.3 - 2026-07-04

### Added
- Grew the example strategy suite to 45. Added 10 weight-based templates: long/short pairs trading with a ratio z-score and with a rolling OLS hedge-ratio spread; dollar-neutral cross-sectional momentum and short-term reversal; volatility-targeted trend and momentum baskets; risk-parity (equal risk contribution) standalone and chained with a per-position cap; Bollinger Band mean reversion; and MACD trend.
- Added a per-folder strategy catalog (`strategies/README.md`) that links each example's source and, where published, its results page, and embedded a summary catalog in the main README.
- Attached the risk-overlay modules (volatility targeting, risk parity, position limits, chained overlays) to runnable examples via the `risk_model=` hook.

## 0.8.2 - 2026-07-04

### Added
- Expanded the example strategy suite to 35 runnable templates: 12 weight-based, 18 order-based, and 5 walk-forward / optimization examples.
- Added an intraday timeframe grid so a single engine spans minute-to-hour cadences: `example_weights_08_intraday_1m_ema_scalp` (1m EMA scalp), `example_orders_15_intraday_5m_bracket_reversion` (5m bracket reversion), `example_orders_16_intraday_30m_stop_breakout` (30m stop breakout), and `example_weights_09_intraday_1h_sma_trend` (1h SMA trend).
- Added rebalance-focused templates that exercise the full policy stack: `example_weights_10_monthly_circuit_breaker` (drawdown circuit breaker + cooldown), `example_weights_11_quarterly_te_cost_gate` (tracking-error trigger + turnover budget), and `example_weights_12_daily_partial_drift` (partial drift-band rebalance).
- Added event-driven order-mode rotation templates: `example_orders_17_monthly_rotation_orders` (calendar rebalance expressed as orders) and `example_orders_18_signal_change_rotation_orders` (trade only on trend-signal flips).
- Added dedicated walk-forward and optimization examples: rolling, expanding, and anchored walk-forward (`example_wf_01`–`example_wf_03`), exhaustive grid search (`example_wf_04`), and Optuna TPE search with out-of-sample validation (`example_wf_05`).
- Surfaced walk-forward traffic-light interpretation (overfit ratio, efficiency, Sharpe decay) directly in the walk-forward examples.

### Changed
- Refreshed public documentation: rewrote the README around what the engine does, why it is reproducible, how to run it, and example report output; removed fixed strategy-count language so the suite can grow without stale numbers.
- Aligned every example strategy configuration with the verified `RebalancePolicy` fields (`drift_threshold`, `tracking_error_threshold`, `max_drawdown_trigger`, `max_annual_turnover`, `partial_rebalance`, `rebalance_on_signal_change`).
- Reworked the packaging smoke tests to check tracked files rather than a fixed strategy count, so new untracked example strategies no longer break local test runs.

### Fixed
- Preserved intraday NaN gaps in `Universe.returns` and `Universe.log_returns` using `pct_change(fill_method=None)`, so halted or illiquid intraday bars are excluded from allocation instead of being counted as 0% return observations.
- Seeded only the first available bar per instrument to a defined return, keeping pre-listing and post-halt gaps as unavailable rather than synthetic zeros.

## 0.8.1 - 2026-07-04

### Added
- Added `granularity` normalization for API-backed backtests, including yfinance historical intraday values such as `1m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, and `1h`.
- Added `example_weights_07_intraday_rsi_15m.py`, a simple RSI strategy using `granularity="15m"`.
- Added true walk-forward refit hooks via fold-local `backtester_factory`/optimizer support.
- Added date/time-aware x-axis labels for intraday time-series plots.
- Added a per-fold "slice diagnostics" warning so walk-forward runs without a refit factory are labeled honestly rather than reported as true out-of-sample.

### Fixed
- Fixed order-mode contract accounting so cash, NAV, position values, weights, and trade value use `ContractSpec` multipliers and lot sizes.
- Fixed order-mode commission notional to use `ContractSpec` multipliers and lot sizes, aligning bps/max-pct fees with contract-aware NAV and PnL.
- Fixed limit and stop-limit execution semantics so slippage never fills worse than the limit price.
- Fixed partial-fill commissions so per-order minimums, caps, and tiers are applied cumulatively to the parent order.
- Fixed reporting-frequency resampling so the first reporting bucket keeps its actual return instead of a synthetic zero.
- Fixed Sharpe, volatility, and Sortino calculations to use metric returns that exclude the synthetic day-0 zero.
- Fixed position-limit redistribution to iteratively enforce `max_weight` after redistributing capped excess.
- Fixed partial rebalance and tax-aware rebalance normalization so frozen positions are not moved by the traded sleeve.
- Fixed benchmark return handling to prefer adjusted total-return sources and warn on ambiguous raw-close or missing-day alignment.
- Fixed dollar valuation semantics to use raw close prices for exposure, turnover, and dollar PnL, with bounded forward-fill for stale valuation prices.
- Preserved NaN market-data gaps in `Universe` and weight-mode rebalancing so unavailable instruments are excluded from allocation instead of treated as 0% return assets.
